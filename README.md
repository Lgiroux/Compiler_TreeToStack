# Compiler_TreeToStack
Wrote a compiler in Python to translate a high-level language using a tree-walking interpreter into a high-level language using a stack interpreter. The compiler recursively walks a tree of nodes of tuples and converts the tuples into a format that is readable by the stack language. Instead of walking a tree of values to interpret the input, the stack interpreter works by pushing and popping values from a stack.
