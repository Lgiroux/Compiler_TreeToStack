# Compiler_TreeToStack
Wrote a compiler in Python to translate a high-level language using a tree-walking interpreter into a high-level language using a stack interpreter. The compiler recursively walks a tree of nodes of tuples and converts the tuples into a format that is readable by the stack language. Instead of walking a tree of values to interpret the input, the stack interpreter works by pushing and popping values from a stack.


Files you will find include grammars, lexers, interpreters and a compiler (cuppa1_stack_codegen).

The compiler translates cuppa1 into stackmachine. 

Assignment6.ipynb is a jupyter notebook showing the execution of the compiler.

 NOTE: 
  
  Not all code is mine, some has been provided by my professor.
